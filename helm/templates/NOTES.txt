1. If helm diff is used it will show some changes regarding TLS certificates for secret and MutationAdmissionWebhook.
   No worries, during helm upgrade these resources will not be changed.
2. Manual cleanup of the following resources needed after chart uninstall:
    a) MutationAdmissionWebhook: "{{ template "wallarm-sidecar.fullname" . }}"
    b) Secret "{{ template "wallarm-sidecar.fullname" . }}-admission-tls" in namespace "{{ .Release.Namespace }}"
